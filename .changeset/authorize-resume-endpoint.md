Add `GET /authorize/resume` endpoint mirroring Auth0's terminal login-session resumption point.

Sub-flows now persist the authenticated identity onto the login session (new `auth_strategy` and `authenticated_at` columns on `login_sessions`) and 302 the browser to `/authorize/resume?state=…`. The resume endpoint owns (a) hopping back to the original authorization host when the browser is on the wrong custom domain so the session cookie lands under the right wildcard, and (b) dispatching based on the login-session state machine to the final token/code issuance or to the next MFA/continuation screen.

The social OAuth callback is migrated as the first consumer: the old 307-POST cross-domain re-dispatch in `connectionCallback` is replaced by a plain 302 to `/authorize/resume`, and the OAuth code exchange now always runs once on whichever host the provider called back to. Subsequent PRs will migrate the password / OTP / signup / SAML sub-flows to the same pattern, after which the ad-hoc `Set-Cookie` forwarding layers in Universal Login can be removed.
