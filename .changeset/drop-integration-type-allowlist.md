Drop `dcr_allowed_integration_types` tenant flag and per-tenant allowlist check on `/connect/start`. `integration_type` is now an optional free-form label — `enable_dynamic_client_registration` alone gates the connect flow. Existing callers that pass `integration_type` continue to work; the value still flows into the IAT constraints and consent screen when supplied.
