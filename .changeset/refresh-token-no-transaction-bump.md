Drop the multi-statement transaction from `refreshTokens.update`. The previous implementation ran UPDATE + SELECT + UPDATE inside `db.transaction()` to extend the parent `login_session` expiry, which on async HTTP drivers (PlanetScale, D1) meant three sequential round-trips plus BEGIN/COMMIT and held a row lock on `login_sessions` across the whole transaction — creating a hot-row hotspot when multiple refresh tokens shared a `login_id`.

- Add optional `UpdateRefreshTokenOptions.loginSessionBump` to the adapter interface. The caller now provides `login_id` and the pre-computed new `expires_at`, so the adapter avoids a read-before-write.
- `refreshTokens.update` issues the refresh-token and login-session UPDATEs concurrently via `Promise.all`, collapsing wall-clock latency to roughly one round-trip on async drivers. The bump is idempotent (`WHERE expires_at_ts < new`) and self-healing (next refresh re-bumps on a transient failure), so strict atomicity is not required.
- Fix `ctx.req.header["x-real-ip"]` / `["user-agent"]` — Hono exposes `header` as a function, so bracket access has been silently writing empty strings to `device.last_ip` / `device.last_user_agent` since the grant landed. Use `ctx.req.header("x-real-ip")` and skip the `device` write entirely when IP and UA are unchanged.
