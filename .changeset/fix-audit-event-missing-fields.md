Preserve `user_id`, `audience`, and `scope` on outbox-delivered log entries. Previously, when `logMessage` was routed through the outbox (e.g., successful login via `post-user-login` hook), the `AuditEvent` → `LogInsert` transform dropped these fields: `actor.id` ignored `params.userId` in favor of only `ctx.var.user_id`, and `audience` was hardcoded to `""` because the `AuditEvent` schema lacked those fields.

- Add optional `audience` and `scope` to `AuditEventInsert`.
- `buildAuditEvent` now falls back `actor.id` to `params.userId`, sets `actor.type = "user"` for user-initiated events, and categorizes them as `"user_action"`.
- `toLogInsert` maps `event.audience` and `event.scope` through to the log row.
