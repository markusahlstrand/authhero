# API Overview

This document provides an overview of the AuthHero API.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication. There are two ways to authenticate:

1. **Bearer Token**: Include an access token in the `Authorization` header
2. **API Key**: Include an API key in the `X-API-Key` header

## Base URL

The base URL for API requests depends on your AuthHero configuration:

- Default: `https://api.yourdomain.com`
- Custom domain: `https://auth.yourdomain.com`

## Response Format

All API responses are in JSON format and include a standard structure:

```json
{
  "data": { ... },  // Response data (if successful)
  "error": { ... }  // Error details (if an error occurred)
}
```

## Rate Limiting

## Versioning
