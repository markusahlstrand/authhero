# Custom Domain Setup

This guide explains how to set up and configure custom domains for your AuthHero authentication pages.

## Overview

Custom domains allow you to provide a branded authentication experience to your users. Instead of using the default AuthHero domain, you can use your own domain (e.g., `auth.yourdomain.com`).

## Prerequisites

- A domain you own and can configure DNS for
- Access to your DNS provider's settings
- Cloudflare adapter configured (if using Cloudflare for custom domains)

## Setup Steps

1. Register your custom domain in AuthHero
2. Configure DNS settings
3. Verify domain ownership
4. Set up SSL certificate
5. Test the custom domain
