# Authentication Flow

This guide explains the authentication flow in AuthHero, covering login, registration, token handling, and session management.

## Overview

AuthHero implements a standard OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect authentication flow, with support for various grant types and authentication methods.

## Login Flow

1. User initiates login at the client application
2. Client redirects to AuthHero login page
3. User enters credentials
4. AuthHero validates credentials
5. On success, AuthHero issues tokens and redirects back to the client application

## Token Types

AuthHero issues several types of tokens:

- **ID Token**: Contains user identity information (JWT format)
- **Access Token**: Grants access to protected resources (JWT format)
- **Refresh Token**: Allows obtaining new access tokens without re-authentication
