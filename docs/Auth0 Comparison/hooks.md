# Hooks: AuthHero vs. Auth0

Auth0 made the decision to deprecate its Hooks feature in October 2024, moving towards Actions as the primary way to customize authentication flows. While Actions offer powerful capabilities, AuthHero continues to support a flexible Hooks system that provides distinct advantages, especially for certain use cases.

## AuthHero's Approach to Hooks

AuthHero's Hooks are designed to be a straightforward way to intercept and modify various stages of the authentication and user lifecycle. A key differentiator in AuthHero is the dual nature of its hooks:

1.  **URL Hooks (Web Hooks)**:

    - Similar to traditional webhooks, you can specify a URL that AuthHero will call at a specific trigger point (e.g., "pre-user-signup", "post-user-login").
    - This allows you to execute custom server-side logic, integrate with external systems, or perform data validation by sending a payload to your endpoint.

2.  **Form Hooks**:
    - Unique to AuthHero, you can configure a hook to render a specific Form instead of calling a URL.
    - By specifying a Form ID, AuthHero will present this form to the user at the designated trigger point in the authentication flow.
    - This is particularly powerful for scenarios like progressive profiling, custom consent gathering, or presenting terms of service updates directly within the flow, often without needing to write any backend code for the form interaction itself.

## Key Differences Summarized

| Feature            | Auth0 (Legacy Hooks) | AuthHero                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Status**         | Deprecated (2024)    | Actively Supported                              |
| **Target Type**    | URL only             | URL (Web Hook) **or** Form ID (Form Hook)       |
| **Use Case Focus** | Custom server logic  | Custom server logic & Codeless form integration |

AuthHero's continued support for Hooks, especially with the addition of Form Hooks, provides a versatile tool for developers looking for both code-based and low-code/no-code customization options within their authentication pipelines.
