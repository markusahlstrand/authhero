# Auth0 Proxy

The Auth0 Proxy is a small proxy server that exposes the Auth0 Management API on a local port. It is primarily intended for testing and development purposes.

## Purpose

This proxy allows you to interact with the Auth0 Management API locally, which is particularly useful when developing and testing the AuthHero management portal. It provides a way to:

- Test AuthHero management features against real Auth0 data
- Develop against the Auth0 API without exposing credentials in your client-side code
- Debug authentication workflows in a controlled environment

## Features

- Simple, lightweight proxy server
- Secure handling of Auth0 credentials
- Compatible with the AuthHero management portal
