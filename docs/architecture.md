# AuthHero Architecture

This document provides an overview of the AuthHero architecture and how its components interact.

## System Overview

AuthHero is built as a modular system with several key components:

1. **Core Library (authhero)**: The main package that handles authentication logic and API requests
2. **Admin Dashboard (react-admin)**: Web application for managing auth tenants
3. **Adapters**: Interface implementations for various databases and services
4. **CLI Tool (create-authhero)**: Command-line interface for creating new projects
