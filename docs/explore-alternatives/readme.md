There are more authentication solutions available today than ever before — each with its own strengths, trade-offs, and ideal use cases.

When I started building this framework, I wasn’t aware of many of the existing options. If I had known more at the time, I might have chosen to contribute to one of them instead of starting from scratch.

Authentication is harder than it looks. It’s not just about logging in and storing tokens — it involves security, edge cases, UX, and integration across systems. If you're considering building your own solution, think twice. It can be a long and tricky road.

That said, if you’re exploring your options — self-hosted or managed, open-source or commercial — this section aims to give you a balanced overview so you can choose what fits your project best.
